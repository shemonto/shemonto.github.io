            <h2>Description</h2>
            <li>Developed Instrumar’s Active Learning Pipeline for fault classification in industrial manufacturing processes, automating the identification and classification of faults.</li>
            <li> Applied SPC based anomaly anomaly detection techniques for identifying real-life manufacturing faults that needs to be classified. </li>
            <li> Performed domain specific feature generation, selection, and dimensionality reduction methods to enhance the quality and efficiency of fault classification.
            <li>Developed a novel balancement algorithm to address data imbalance challenges inherent in Instrumar’s time series data, ensuring robust and accurate fault classification.</li>
            <li>Implemented multiple active learning strategies to intelligently select the most informative data samples for annotation, optimizing the training process and reducing annotation cost and time.</li>
            <li>Integrated state-of-the-art machine learning models including XGBoost, GradientBoosting Classifier, and Neural Networks to leverage the power of advanced algorithms for fault classification.</li>
            <li>Achieved significant improvements in fault classification efficiency, contributing to enhanced operational performance and cost savings for Instrumar.</li>
